# 6.坞站集线器

Joshua Cook<sup class="calibre5">1 </sup> (1)Santa Monica, California, USA   Equipped with tools for developing our own images, it quickly becomes important to be able to save and share the images we have written beyond our system. Docker Registries allow us to do just this. For your purposes, the public Docker Registry, Docker Hub, will be more than sufficient, though it is worth noting that other registries exist and that it is possible to create and host your own registry. Overall, the Docker Registry consists of three technologies: the Index, the Registry, and the Repository. In this text, a cursory understanding of how these technologies interact is sufficient. The Index tracks meta-information associated with users, organizations, namespaces, and repositories. The Repository is similar to a git repository in that it tracks multiple versions of a project (that is, a Docker image). The Registry contains the images and the repository graph comprising a Repository.

## 坞站集线器

A Docker Registry is a server-side application that can be used to distribute Docker images. We are most interested in the free-to-use, public Docker Registry, Docker Hub.[<sup class="calibre6">1</sup>](#Fn1) Docker Hub is to Docker somewhat as GitHub is to Git. It allows us to use existing Docker repositories and allows us to build and host our own images. It will serve for the vast majority of your work as your sole Docker Registry from which you will discover the images you will use, manage the development of your images, and automate the build process as you move toward production-ready images.

### 坞站集线器替代方案

Two of the most popular alternative public registries are Quay.io[<sup class="calibre6">2</sup>](#Fn2) and the Google Container Registry.[<sup class="calibre6">3</sup>](#Fn3) Quay.io is a public and private registry service run by CoreOS. CoreOS is the developer of the primary container engine alternative to Docker, rkt.[<sup class="calibre6">4</sup>](#Fn4) In the past year, however, CoreOS and Docker seem to be working more as allies than competitors and Quay.io can serve as a registry for both Docker and rkt-defined images. Quay has tools for the maintenance of images by organizations and teams plus workflow automation tools, and it is an excellent alternative to Docker Hub. Google was an early organizational adopter of containerization technology and is the origin of one of the community’s most beloved tools, the orchestration tool Kubernetes. It is no surprise that Google has its own container registry, the Google Container Registry. For our purposes, that is, for the purposes of data science, we might most be interested in using the GCR as the home of the in-house images for Google’s machine intelligence library, Tensorflow.[<sup class="calibre6">5</sup>](#Fn5)

## Docker ID 和名称空间

In order to leverage the services offered by Docker Hub, you will create a Docker ID. A new Docker ID can be created via the Docker Cloud sign-up page.[<sup class="calibre6">6</sup>](#Fn6) Creation of a Docker ID will require email verification. Once created, your Docker ID also becomes your main namespace you will use for all of your images hosted on Docker Hub. My Docker ID is joshuacook. Were I to push the gsl image we created in Chapter [4](04.html) to Docker Hub, this image would be available at the namespace/tag combination of joshuacook/gsl. More generally, the namespace/tag of an image hosted on Docker Hub will appear as in Listing [6-1](#Par14). <namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> Listing 6-1.General Namespace/Tag for an Image on Docker Hub Were you to use an image not hosted on Docker Hub, such as the Tensorflow GPU image as in Listing [6-2](#Par16), you would need to specify the full URI including the registry address, following the pattern outlined in Listing [6-3](#Par17). gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu Listing 6-2.Full URI for the Latest Tensorflow GPU Image <registry_address>/<namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> Listing 6-3.General URI for a Registry-Hosted Image

## 图像存储库

A repository on Docker Hub is a collection of tagged, built Docker images sharing the same purpose. Visiting my user page, you can see all of the Docker repositories I am currently maintaining (Figure [6-1](#Fig1)). Each repository contains one or more images that have been previously defined and built, either locally or via the Docker Hub Automated Build process.![A439726_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.jpg](img/A439726_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.jpg) Figure 6-1.My Docker Hub user profile

## 搜索现有存储库

As previously noted, the Docker Hub registry is the default registry used by the Docker CLI. As such, it is a trivial process to search the Docker Hub for relevant images using the Docker CLI using the docker search command. A keyword search via the docker search command checks the keyword against image name, users, and organizations, as well as an image description. In Listing [6-4](#Par21), you search Docker Hub for miniconda images. Note Images are returned in descending order based upon their number of stars. $ docker search miniconda NAME                          DESCRIPTION                         STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED continuumio/miniconda         Powerful and flexible package ...   38[OK] alaindomissy/docker-miniconda docker-miniconda                    2[OK] yamitzky/miniconda-neologd    Dockernized mecab-ipadic-NEolo...   2[OK] show0k/alpine-miniconda       An alpine based image with min...   1[OK] kentwait/miniconda-mpi        Docker container for developin...   1[OK] pottava/miniconda             Miniconda images based on Alpi...   1[OK] Listing 6-4.Search Docker Hub for miniconda Images The search returns results both where the search term miniconda appears in the name and in the description. Having identified the image you wish to use, you can pull the image as you did in Chapter [3](03.html) using docker pull (Listing [6-5](#Par23)). $ docker pull continuumio/miniconda Using default tag: latest latest: Pulling from continuumio/miniconda 8ad8b3f87b37: Pull complete 090d0f0e845b: Pull complete 3cc1bbd57a94: Pull complete bd7b36ac12a3: Pull complete Digest: sha256:f7e0a8a86a6d194e748c5884f53ddbbde33b08a666bed5370e453f35bbc3ec57 Status: Downloaded newer image for continuumio/miniconda:latest Listing 6-5.Pull the continuumio/miniconda Image

## 标记的图像

There is an active,[<sup class="calibre6">7</sup>](#Fn7) well-known, and friendly split in the Python community between versions 2 and 3\. The implications of this are that any Python technology must be capable of being run against two major versions of Python. On your personal computer, this is a significant task requiring package managers supporting both Python 2 and 3 and a virtual environment system such as virtualenv or that provided by conda. With Docker, this task is trivially managed with a Docker image tag. Image tags define variations in the definition of an image under a single namespace and repository combination. Tags have no semantic meaning, nor does your Docker Id or the name of your repository. They serve solely to distinguish between subtle changes made to images. An image can be given a tag in any of three ways:

1.  1.在构建时，只需在图像名称的末尾加上:<tag>就可以标记图像(清单 [6-6](#Par31) )。使用这种方法，标记的图像将与特定的 Dockerfile 文件相关联。</tag>
2.  2.之后可以使用 docker tag 命令标记图像(清单 [6-7](#Par32) )。使用这种方法，标记的图像将与特定的 Dockerfile 文件相关联。
3.  3.使用 docker commit 命令(清单 [6-8](#Par33) )可以将对容器所做的短暂更改保存为新的映像。使用这种方法，将不存在描述对图像所做的短暂改变的 Dockerfile 文件。

$ docker build -t <namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> Listing 6-6.Tag an Image During a Build $ docker tag <existing_image> <namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> Listing 6-7.Retag an Existing Local Image $ docker commit <existing_container> <namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> Listing 6-8.Commit Changes to a Container as a Tagged Image You will revisit this last as a best practice in maintaining semipersistent changes to images in the next chapter.

### Python 图像上的标签

The python image can be found at the official repository page[<sup class="calibre6">8</sup>](#Fn8) for Python. Visiting the Tags tab, you can see specific information about the dozens of tags associated with the Python repository. The Python repository uses image tags to not only manage the Python 2 and Python 3 split, but to manage four different versions of Python 3\. From the official repository page, you can link to the Dockerfiles used to define the individually tagged images in the Python repository (see Figure [6-2](#Fig2)).![A439726_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg](img/A439726_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg) Figure 6-2.The Python Official Repository page

### 官方知识库

Docker maintains a set of curated Docker images for the major open-source technologies. These official repositories are designed using established best practices in writing Dockerfiles (and more likely than not are maintained by tianon [<sup class="calibre6">9</sup>](#Fn9) ). You saw your first official repository in the Official Repository for Python. With the exception of the jupyter image (which you shall treat as though it is an Official Repository), you will nearly always use Official Repositories as your base image.

## 推到码头中心

To demonstrate the process of pushing to Docker Hub, you will create a new image, numpy-notebook . This image will use the jupyter/base-notebook image as its base and add numpy. Recall that the jupyter/base-notebook image includes only Python 3\. You will only add numpy for Python 3. Note In Chapter [5](05.html), you configured your system for local development by setting up a project to be tracked via git and GitHub. This is a best practice. You will not go through this practice for the creation of an image in this chapter. This is not because it is not a good practice, but rather because I wish to emphasize that working with Docker Hub is independent from working with git. In Listing [6-9](#Par42), you create a new local directory to hold your project and a subdirectory to serve the context for your new image. $ mkdir ch_6_dockerfiles && cd ch_6_dockerfiles $ mkdir numpy Listing 6-9.Create a New Local Directory and Context Subdirectory In Listing [6-10](#Par45), you create a new Dockerfile (shown in Listing [6-11](#Par46)). The new image is defined using the jupyter/base-notebook image as a base. In order to install numpy you briefly switch the image’s USER to root. You use conda to install numpy and then switch back to USER jovyan. Note You switch to the user root to install the libraries and switch back to user jovyan upon completion. This is considered a best practice and ensures that you do not run the notebook server with too much system privilege. More on this in Chapter [7](07.html). $ vi numpy/Dockerfile Listing 6-10.Create a New Dockerfile FROM jupyter/base-notebook USER root RUN conda install --yes numpy USER jovyan Listing 6-11.The numpy Dockerfile In Listing [6-12](#Par48), you build the numpy image using the docker build command. Note that the term numpy shows up twice in the command. The first (-t numpy) refers to the tag or name that you are giving to the image. The second, the last word in the command, refers to the relatively referenced build context, in this case the subdirectory named numpy. $ docker build -t numpy numpy Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB Step 1/4 : FROM jupyter/base-notebook ... Step 2/4 : USER root ... Step 3/4 : RUN conda install numpy ... Step 4/4 : USER jovyan ... Successfully built 2570ccf8069f Successfully tagged numpy:latest Listing 6-12.Build the numpy Image In Listing [6-13](#Par50), you run the ipython REPL using the numpy image you just built as a means of testing your installation. You use Ctrl+D to exit the containerized process after completing a trivial calculation. $ docker run -it numpy ipython Python 3.6.1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 23 2017, 14:16:20) Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 6.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help. In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: u = np.array((1,2)) In [3]: np.linalg.norm(u) Out[3]: 2.2360679774997898 In [4]: Do you really want to exit ([y]/n)? Listing 6-13.Run ipython from the numpy Image

### 创建新的存储库

Creating a new repository can be done via a Docker Hub user profile (see Figure [6-3](#Fig3)). You will be prompted to give the repository a name, a short description, and a full description. You will also be asked whether the repository should be public or private. By default, new repositories will be public.![A439726_1_En_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg](img/A439726_1_En_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg) Figure 6-3.Create a new repository Again, there is no semantic meaning to the name given to a repository. With regard to the description, you should recall that keywords entered in the description were found by the docker search function. Note You could also choose to create the repository in any organization where you have the proper privileges. You create a new repository called numpy with the short description “Numerical Python” and the full description “Built on jupyter/base-notebook.” The new repository is shown in Figure [6-4](img/#Fig4).![A439726_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg](img/A439726_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg) Figure 6-4.The new joshuacook/numpy repository

### 推送图像

You might wish to push the work you did on your numpy image. Local images created in the manner discussed in Chapter [5](05.html) can be pushed to Docker Hub with little fuss, provided they are named in the <namespace>/<repository_name>:<tag> pattern. In order to push your work, you first revisit the state of the images on your system via the docker images command (Listing [6-14](#Par56)), especially to examine the numpy image you just created. $ docker images REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE numpy            latest    2570ccf8069f    33 minutes ago    925MB jupyter/         latest    161472bc6c75    2 weeks ago       657MB base-notebook debian           latest    47af6ca8a14a    2 weeks ago       125.1 MB miniconda3       latest    5865a6cfa8c2    2 weeks ago       1.64 GB Listing 6-14.Display Local Images Note None of your images have a namespace or a tag. Again, there are three ways to give a tag to an image: 1) at build-time using docker build 2) after build-time using docker tag, and 3) by committing changes made to a container as an image using docker commit. In Listing [6-15](#Par59), you give the numpy image a tag and a namespace using the docker tag command. $ docker tag numpy joshuacook/numpy:1.13.0 Listing 6-15.Tag an Image In Listing [6-16](#Par61), you once more display your local images. $ docker images REPOSITORY     TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE numpy          latest     2570ccf8069f    34 minutes ago    925MB joshuacook/    1.13.0     2570ccf8069f    34 minutes ago    925MBnumpy jupyter/       latest     161472bc6c75    2 weeks ago       657MBbase-notebook debian         latest     47af6ca8a14a    2 weeks ago       125.1MB miniconda3     latest     5865a6cfa8c2    2 weeks ago       1.64GB Listing 6-16.Display Local Images You now have an image with the namespace/repository combination of joshuacook/numpy and the tag of 1.13.0\. Note that it has an identical image id with the numpy image. Docker is not storing two identical images, but rather maintaining two references to the same image. In order to push to Docker Hub, you must log in via the Docker CLI using docker login (Listing [6-17](#Par64)). $ docker login Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one. Username (joshuacook): Password: Login Succeeded Listing 6-17.Log in to Docker Hub Once you have properly tagged your image and logged in, you use the docker push command (Listing [6-18](#Par66)). $ docker push joshuacook/numpy:1.13.0 The push refers to a repository [docker.io/joshuacook/numpy] 2bcb5be18c74: Pushed 72c56d765cf2: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 317e6c337ef3: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 1a2fceb0b4da: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook c65670cc3813: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 52b6625b711f: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 93329dd321d3: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 7c10c4ddeab0: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 290b555a5673: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 6b538a724de5: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook f02f8903fe33: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 406306ca7a80: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook cff5883220e6: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook d17d48b2382a: Mounted from jupyter/base-notebook 1.13.0: digest: sha256:ccd8f21923c7538ae7a4d0606e203dce072d601494e570cf4c3d1d08ca7a84e2 size: 3246 Listing 6-18.Push the ipython Image to Docker Hub

### 从 Docker Hub 提取图像

You can verify the success of your push by pulling the image from Docker Hub. Of course, if you have the image locally, the locally cached image will be used when the image is requested. In order to test the success, you first inspect the contents of your local image using the docker inspect command in order to use this for verification (Listing [6-19](#Par69)). You are interested in the "RootFS" key in the JSON returned by the inspect command, as it provides a sha256 description[<sup class="calibre6">10</sup>](#Fn10) description of each layer associated with the image. $ docker inspect joshuacook/numpy:1.13.0 ...         "RootFS": {             "Type": "layers",             "Layers": [                 "sha256:d17d48b2382adda1fd94284c51d725f0226bf20b07f4d29ce09596788bed7e8e",                 "sha256:cff5883220e61c711e6345366431e2eb28d8b408ae02c21c1356797932379f7f",                 "sha256:406306ca7a8025fd3430c01289c18e5ed18f0a144e7b6f1bc592ad38817f52a3",                 "sha256:f02f8903fe334cbe7184c6d57fc08e6b5d26b607fce64c090c079d2a996f14a3",                 "sha256:6b538a724de5d6ecdbfa4583dc34a228a46c3ee0c4d309a481e9dfad675de380",                 "sha256:290b555a56733ef2f2a005e6c7a3c38d894674239aed477729092687c414015d",                 "sha256:7c10c4ddeab02a978638181a43ac67d43036fc6bf67e9888544debbd63aa11b3",                 "sha256:93329dd321d38f8394e015b422cf3680be1de5568f7248a3b635df329b2fe47b",                 "sha256:52b6625b711fbf05039b819e2d13161f5c36c1909ad61779efedae05a5fdc51c",                 "sha256:c65670cc38137214111c9e1587cb200e32e74de13fc2957752d6354f75da6278",                 "sha256:1a2fceb0b4daff636aa021a223b46c308a94e52f084c9feea395b68f672be6cb",                 "sha256:317e6c337ef3c57618c38257236cc02e254f2f8d499249fbc040208f25c360d9",                 "sha256:72c56d765cf2ae7ce7626b5a35bf0eba94f8c49b1a8d894b999949846b2ded71",                 "sha256:2bcb5be18c742a706f4667ce18b59e45d777e01d2423aac3c035c0d2831e34fc"             ]         } ... Listing 6-19.Inspect the ipython Image You will use these layer descriptions to verify against the image once you have pulled it from Docker Hub.

It is of note that the pull proves to be rather trivial, only needing to fetch a single layer from Docker Hub. This is because most of the layers associated with your numpy image exist as the jupyter/base-notebook image. You used the jupyter/base-notebook image as the base upon which you built your ipython image!

Finally, let’s visit the Tags tab on the Docker Hub page associated with your numpy repository (Figure [6-5](#Fig5)). Here, you can see that that tagged image you pushed is indeed available on Docker Hub.![A439726_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg](img/A439726_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg) Figure 6-5.The joshuacook/numpy Docker Hub page

## 摘要

In this chapter, you looked at using Docker Hub as a cloud-based store for the images you have built. You learned about multiple versions of images, looking at how tags are used to track multiple versions of the Python community image. You created a new image for using the numpy library built using the jupyter/base-notebook image as a base, tagged it with the current version of numpy, and pushed it to your Docker Hub account. After this chapter, I hope that you are familiar with the process of creating a new image from a Dockerfile and know how to push an image that you create to Docker Hub.
